		WSL

First: you need to enable WSL in windows:

You have two opcions:
	1. Control panel -> enable or disable Windows features ->
	enable wsl and Virtual platform
	2. run next comand in powershell:

	Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux

second: You need to install linux distribution

you can do it, like this:

	wsl --install -d <Distribution Name>
	put username and password and then you have
	linux in windows.

	
		ZSH


I use windows terminal preview,to open linux terminal.

installation:
	run the next comands:
		sudo apt install zsh
	verication:
		--version
	default shell:
		chsh -s $(which zsh)
	Restart your Computer

	You can verify the default shell, with the next comand:
	echo $SHELL

		Oh-My-Zsh

Installation:
	You need to install git and node.js for some oh-my-zsh's plugins
	then, run the next comand:
		sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

Install theme:
	open the zshrc file with any code editor:
	example: 
		vim ~/.zshrc
	then you can change the theme, changing:
		ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
		by
		ZSH_THEME="another theme"
