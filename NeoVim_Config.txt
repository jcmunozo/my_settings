route of installation:

you must clone my repo: git clone git@github.com:jcmunozo/my_settings.git
change the name to nvim (my_settings -> nvim)
then put in the next route:

wait a minute when the process is finished, close the nvim and run again nvim, and you will have nvim full.


** Recomendations 

If you have this problem with coc and python:
[coc.nvim] Error on execute python script: request error nvim_comand - Vim(pyxfile):E319: No "python3" provider found.
i fix this with:
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pynvim
python -m pip install --user --upgrade pynvim
this solution i found in https://dev.to/andreneji/comment/1ah5g 


for python autocomplete i installed:
coc-jedi
and intall: pip install -U jedi-language-server
